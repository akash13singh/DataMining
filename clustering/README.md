This archive contains the data and useful scripts for Set1 homeworks.

There are three data sets provided through canvas: C1.txt,C2.txt,C3.txt. 

These data sets all have the following format.  Each line is a data point. The lines have either 3 or 6 tab separated items. The first one is an integer describing the index of the points. The next 2 (or 5 for C3) are the coordinates of the data point. C1 and C2 are in 2 dimensions, and C3 is in 5 dimensions. C1 should have n=20 points, C2 should have n=1004 points, and C3 should have n=1000 points.  We will always measure distance with Euclidean distance

To read the data sets you can use the script "**dataloader_1b.py**".

Python distribution with pre-compiled scientific libraries (SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib) can be downloaded from the web page: [Anaconda for Windows / OS X / Linux](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
